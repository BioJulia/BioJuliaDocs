## Description

The BioJuliaDocs initiative is an in-development project to produce a landing site for BioJulia
similar to [SciMLDocs](https://github.com/SciML/SciMLDocs) (see the production page [here](https://docs.sciml.ai/Overview/stable/)).

## Testing

The rendered BioJuliaDocs site, for testing purposes, is published online using GitHub Pages at [biojulia.dev/BioJuliaDocs](https://biojulia.dev/BioJuliaDocs). A GitHub action rebuilds the site on every successful pull request.

To deploy the site locally:
```julia
# Make sure you are within or are pointing to the the docs/ folder
using Documenter, LiveServer
include("make.jl")
serve(dir="build")
```

## Contributing

We appreciate contributions from users/members of the BioJulia commmunity
including reporting bugs/typos, fixing issues, and adding new sections.
This is a fantastic opportunity to polish one's technical writing skills as well as show off one's skill with BioJulia packages ;)

Take a look at the [contributing files](https://github.com/BioJulia/Contributing)
detailed contributor and maintainer guidelines, and code of conduct.
