## Description
The BioJuliaDocs initiative is an in-development project to produce a landing site for BioJulia similar to [SciMLDocs](https://github.com/SciML/SciMLDocs) (see the production page [here](https://docs.sciml.ai/Overview/stable/)).

## Testing
The rendered BioJuliaDocs site, for testing purposes, is published online using GitHub Pages at [m-persic.github.io/BioJuliaDocs](https://m-persic.github.io/BioJuliaDocs). A GitHub action rebuilds the site on every successful pull request.

## Contributing
We appreciate contributions from users/members of the BioJulia commmunity including reporting bugs/typos, fixing issues, and adding new sections. This is a fantastic opportunity to polish one's technical writing skills as well as show off one's skill with BioJulia packages ;)

Take a look at the [contributing files](https://github.com/BioJulia/Contributing)
detailed contributor and maintainer guidelines, and code of conduct.

## Questions?
Feel free to open a new discussion under the [BioJuliaDocs Discussions](https://github.com/M-PERSIC/BioJuliaDocs/discussions) section. Alternatively, one can chat with the community either via the [Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) #biology workspace or in the [forums](https://discourse.julialang.org/).

This project is lead by [Michael Persico](mailto:michael.a.persico@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]) (him/il) as part of a Julia Summer of Code project. Feel free to contact me directly should you wish to address any concerns privately.
