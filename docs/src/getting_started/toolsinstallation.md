## [Julia REPL](@id julia-repl)

A REPL, or read-eval-print loop, represents a language "shell" or program that
allows the user to communicate with the programming language interactively with
immediate feedback. This allows for exploring the language more deeply than via
a script, with rapid prototyping being much quicker and easier to perform.

The Julia REPL is included by default in every Julia installation and boasts a
number of features to the point that it alone can almost be considered a proper
IDE. It should appear the moment you enter `julia` into your terminal:

```
   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |
   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type "?" for help, "]?" for Pkg help.
  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |
  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.9.2 (2023-07-05)
 _/ |\__'_|_|_|\__'_|  |  Official https://julialang.org/ release
|__/                   |

julia> 
```

Not every feature that the REPL provides will be shown, however here is a quick
list that most Julia users should know to make the most of this shell:

* There are 5 Julia REPL modes that serve separate purposes: 

  1. The Julian (default) mode wherein one can write, load, and test out code
  2. Help mode for printing documentation for functions, keywords, etc.
  3. Pkg mode for working with the included package manager and manipulating
     dependencies/packages
  4. Shell mode to execute system commands (run a terminal from Julia which
     itself is running from a terminal!) 
  5. Search modes (forward, reverse) to look through your history of inputs

|        Prompt         |         Key binding         |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------:|
|       `julia> `       |     None (default mode)     |
|       `help?> `       | `?` or `??` (extended help) |
|    `(@v1.x) pkg> `    |             `]`             |
|       `shell> `       |             `;`             |
| `(reverse-i-search):` |            `^R`             |
| `(forward-i-search):` |            `^S`             |

* If you have a code editor installed on your development machine, you can go
  back and forth between the Julia session and the editor by entering `julia>
  edit("<name of file>")`. You can jump right back into the Julia session once
  you're finished!
* You can get a list of matches to a partially written word by entering the TAB
  key, which also serves to render an Unicode symbol in the REPL (full list
  available in the [Unicode
  Input](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/unicode-input/) section of the
  Julia manual): 
  
  ```julia
  julia> pri[TAB]
  primitive type  print           println         printstyled
  julia> \pi[TAB] # renders Ï€
  ```
* You can run a standalone script by entering `include("<name of script>")` in
  Julian mode. For greater control, the equivalent of Python3's `if __name__ ==
  __main__` condition would be `if abspath(<name of program file>) == @__FILE__`

!!! warning 
    One common gotcha with the Julia REPL is that there are currently
    certain code changes that cannot be performed without restarting your
    session, such as redefining structs (see the example below). You can
    mitigate this by adding the
    [Revise](https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/) package, although
    restarting the session is the simplest option. 
    ```julia
    julia> struct Point
            x::Int 
            y::Int 
           end
    
    julia> struct Point
            x::Int
            z::Int
           end
    ERROR: invalid redefinition of constant Point
    Stacktrace:
    [1] top-level scope
    @ REPL[2]:1
    ```

To learn more, see the [The Julia
REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/) section in the Julia
manual.

## Visual Studio Code extension

The Julia organization officially supports the [julia-vscode
extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org/) which, together with VSCode, provides
a complete solution for developing in Julia similar to a fully integrated
development environment (IDE). This boasts a number of advantages compared to a
pure REPL-driven solution:

* Built-in syntax highlighting and code completion
* GUI interaction for managing options and commands
* Advanced profiling/debugging features 
* Additional extensions support 

To install vscode, follow the instructions on how to install the official binary
for your development machine from the [official
website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Next, click on the Extension icon in
the side Activity Bar and search for "Julia". The official Julia extension
should be the first extension available. You can also install Julia within the
Quick Open input panel by pressing `Ctrl + P` and entering `ext install
julialang.language-julia`.

![Julia VSCode Extension](../assets/JuliaVSCodeExtension.png)

Install the extension and restart vscode. We also recommend installing some
additional extensions that will further improve the development experience:

* [Even Better
  TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml)
  (`ext install tamasfe.even-better-toml`) for working with the package TOML
  files (Project.toml, Manifest.toml, Artifacts.toml,...)
* [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
  (`ext install eamodio.gitlens`) for enhancing Git workflows

You can experiment with Julia extension features in the Quick Open panel by
writing Julia and consulting the available options. To learn more, visit the
[Julia in Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia) page or the [Julia
extension's](https://www.julia-vscode.org/) official website.

## Alternative Editor/IDE extensions

Although [julia-vscode](https://www.julia-vscode.org/) is the only officially
supported extension, community extensions are available for a range of code
editors/IDEs:

- [julia-emacs](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-emacs.git) that
  integrates a new major mode for developing in Julia 
- [julia-vim](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-vim.git) to enable
  Julia support for Vim/Neovim
- [julia-sublime](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/Julia-sublime.git) to
  enable Julia support for Sublime

Certain editors/IDEs, such as [GodBolt](https://godbolt.org/) and
[Replit](https://replit.com/lm/julia), already support Julia without extensions.
Finally, many editors, like [micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/), natively
include support for basic features such as code highlighting or simple
autocomplete.

## Notebooks

A reactive notebook is an interactive environment that combines elements of a
code editor and a REPL into one solution. One writes code in executable blocks
of "cells" that can be mixed with text and other assets to create a reproducible
document that is shareable and easily manipulable. Notebooks are especially
useful for scientific exploration since code can be rapidly prototyped in an
isolated environment that can be both visualized and documented in the same
file.

There are two standard methods for working with Julia in notebooks:

### IJulia (Julia kernel for Jupyter)

The Julia organization officially supports the
[IJulia](https://julialang.github.io/IJulia.jl/stable/) kernel, or backend, for
Jupyter notebooks, which is the most popular web-based notebook solution. 

To install IJulia/Jupyter and run the notebook server:

!!! note
    Instead of loading Pkg, one can simply activate pkg mode with the `]` key and enter `(@v1.9) pkg> add <package name here>`

  1. Install Julia via any method mentioned in the [Installing Julia](@ref juliainstallation) section
  2. Open the Julia REPL by entering `julia` into your terminal
  3. Add the IJulia package via the built-in package manager: `julia> using Pkg;Pkg.add("IJulia")`
  4. Load IJulia and launch the notebook server: `julia> using IJulia; notebook()` 
     (run `notebook(detached=true)` if you wish that the notebook, and `notebook(dir="/some/path")` if you wish to open a notebook in a )
     server sruns in the background even if the Julia session is closed)
  5. Enter `y` to install Jupyter via Conda if you have not done so already on
     your machine

The notebook dashboard should open within your web browser. If you already have
jupyter installed ([Installing Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)), you can
enter `n` when prompted by the Julia REPL and instead run `jupyter notebook`
from the terminal. Visit the [Running
IJulia](https://julialang.github.io/IJulia.jl/stable/manual/running/#Running-IJulia)
section in the official IJulia docs for more information.

### Pluto notebooks

[Pluto.jl](https://plutojl.org/) is an alternative notebook solution built with
Julia in mind. It integrates well with the language and boasts a number of
features that are not available or are difficult to achieve with the Jupyter
solution:

* Works with Julia's built-in package manager for native reproducibility
* Live docs feature, essentially Julia's help mode available within the notebook
* Works with normal Julia (.jl) files as opposed to .ipynb files
* Extendable via packages like
  [PlutoUI](https://featured.plutojl.org/basic/plutoui.jl) and
  [PlutoPDF](https://github.com/JuliaPluto/PlutoPDF.jl.git)

To install and run the Pluto server:

  1. Install Julia via any method mentioned in the [Installing Julia](@ref juliainstallation) section
  2. Open the Julia REPL by entering `julia` into your terminal
  3. Add the Pluto package via the built-in package manager: `julia> using Pkg;Pkg.add("Pluto")`
  4. Load Pluto and launch the notebook server: `julia> using Pluto; Pluto.run()` 
  5. Copy/paste the given URL (http://localhost:...) into your web browser

A number of featured notebooks are [available
online](https://featured.plutojl.org/) that include basic tutorials and powerful
demonstrations achieved with Pluto.
