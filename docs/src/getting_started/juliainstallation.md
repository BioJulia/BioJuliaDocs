# [Installing Julia](@id juliainstallation)

There are a number of official methods available to install Julia, each with
their own purposes and advantages:

## juliaup (recommended)

[juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup.git) is a Julia manager/version
multiplexer tool designed to handle your Julia installation from the
command-line. It is the easiest and most convenient installation option, and is
available on almost all platforms that support Julia.

- If you are running **Linux or Mac**, enter the following command in your
  terminal:

```
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh
```

- If you are running **Windows**, enter the following:

```
winget install julia -s msstore
```

- If you have the **Rust** programming language installed on your machine, you
  can generate the `juliaup` executable via the Cargo package manager:

!!! warning 
  This is not recommended for the most users, and should be avoided
  unless you cannot download the official juliaup executable.

```
cargo install juliaup
```

## Docker/Podman

An [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/julia) is available,
allowing you to build containers with Julia already installed. This can be a
preferred method of installation if you wish to run Ju lia in a sandboxed,
ephemeral (temporary) instance or are looking to include Julia in a
containerized application.

You must first download the image via the Docker or Podman command-line tool:

!!! note 
  If you are using Podman, you can replace the keyword `docker` with
  `podman` in any of the following commands!

```
docker pull julia:latest
```

You can specify which version of the image you wish to install via tags, such as
`latest`, `rc`, `1.6`, etc.

To create a container instance, run the following command:

!!! note 
  If you had skipped the previous test, then Docker/Podman will
  automatically begin installing the container image for you here!

```
docker run -it --rm --network host julia:latest
```

The above command creates an interactive container that will be deleted the
moment you exit via the `--rm` option and that will share your machine's network
namespace via the `--network host` option (allow for automatic port bindings).
You may remove either option to disable these behaviours.

The image itself can serve as a base for your custom container built from a
Dockerfile/Containerfile:

```
FROM julia:latest
# ...
```

If you wish to use a different image as the basis of your container, yet still
require Julia, you can use any of the other installation methods listed in this
section in your Dockerfile/Containerfile. A few examples with `juliaup`:

```
# First option: Install juliaup via curl
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt update && \
    apt install -y curl && \
    curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh -s -- -y # install juliaup non-interactively

RUN juliaup add release
```

## Manual download

You can also install the Julia executable directly from the Julia website's
[Manual Download section](https://julialang.org/downloads/#manual_download). You
must make sure to install the correct Julia executable based on your machine's:

- native instruction set (x86_64, i686, ARM, Apple Silicon, PowerPC)
- operating system type (Windows, MacOS, Linux (Glibc), Linux (Musl), FreeBSD)
- bit compute type (32-bit, 64-bit)

Make sure to follow the
[platform specific instructions](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/) for
your machine in order to ensure the best experience.

## Build from source

You may build Julia from the source code that is openly available in the
[Julia GitHub repository](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia.git). Please
consult the
[Building Julia (Detailed) section](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/devdocs/build/build/)
of the Julia manual for more details.
