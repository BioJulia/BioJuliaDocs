BioJulia is a passionate, community-led organization providing biology-related
packages written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).
The organization offers a comprehensive, fully open-source ecosystem of both
libraries that serve as essential building blocks for other packages as well as
interactive tools for everyday tasks and workflows. 

Biologists and other scientists are fully empowered by Julia to easily tackle
domain-specific challenges, taking advantage of features including:
* [Fully reproducible
  environments](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/) thanks to
  Julia's built-in package manager
* [Competitive performance](https://julialang.org/benchmarks/) that rivals that
  of lower-level, more complex languages such as C and Fortran
* [Unicode-based math symbol
  support](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/unicode-input/), [transparent
  BLAS
  integration](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#man-linalg),
  and additional features for performing complex numerical operations   
* [A batteries-included read-eval-print loop
  (REPL)](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#The-Julia-REPL) for
  interactive data exploration and prototyping
* [Seamless
  interoperability](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/calling-c-and-fortran-code/#Calling-C-and-Fortran-Code)
  [(JLLs,](https://docs.binarybuilder.org/stable/#Project-flow)
  [Cmd,...)](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/running-external-programs/#Running-External-Programs)
  with other languages via multiple foreign function interfaces
